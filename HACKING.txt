Release HOWTO
=============

To make a release, 

  1) Update release date/version in NEWS.txt and setup.py
  2) Run 'python setup.py sdist'
  3) Test the generated source distribution in dist/
  4) Upload to PyPI: 'python setup.py sdist register upload'
  if 4) fails, you can use twine to upload the package:
  twine upload dist/*
  5) Increase version in setup.py (for next release)
